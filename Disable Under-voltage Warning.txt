Disable Under-voltage Warning (Not Recommended)
Under-voltage may cause SD card corruption and/or other problems. Disabling the warning won’t make it any better. But if you understand the risk, it can be disabled by the steps below. I tested it with Raspbian Stretch (November 2017 version).

Open /boot/config.txt file.

# Disable under-voltage warning
avoid_warnings=1

Reboot to apply the change.
sudo reboot
