Force the screen to stay on


sudo nano /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf
Add the following lines to the [SeatDefaults] section:


# don't sleep the screen
xserver-command=X -s 0 dpms

[SeatDefaults]
xserver-command=X -s 0 -dpms

I know this is old, but this didn't work for me at first either. 
Make sure that what you add/edit comes after [SeatDefaults] and 
I think the correct command is xserver-command=X -s 0 -dpms (notice the '-' before dpms)

The easiest way to disable screen blanking in the Raspbian GUI is to install 
xscreensaver then configure it to disable:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install xscreensaver


Disable_Screen_Sleep_on_Raspberry_Pi

August 26, 2016

There are many different links recommending you update many different config files to disable the screen from sleeping on a Raspberry Pi, but this is the simplest solution I've come across:

sudo apt-get install xscreensaver
Now open the app xscreensaver
Click Settings, then at the top choose Disable Screen Sleep from the dropdown. Now you're done!

Try adding the following to the /boot/cmdline.txt file :
consoleblank=0

(make sure it is added to the existing line of text - do not add a new line)

sudo nano /etc/kbd/config
BLANK_TIME=0 (Was 30)
POWERDOWN_TIME=0 (I think it was 15)
That method only works for the console, it won't stop desktop blanking
